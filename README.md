Odin Recipes is a HTML Project, assigned by The Odin Project to
apply all the basic HTML knowledge. 

Here I was asked to create a homepage, with links to recipes in it.
Each recipe page is supposed to use appropriate heading elements, provide description, ingredients and steps. 
They should also have link to home page for easy navigation. 

**After the completion of this project, I**

-learnt a new element figure which is used to write a caption for the image. 

-Realised ul and ol can be used as nested lists of each other during implementation of Biryani Recipe page. 

-realised the importance of file structure while building a project.

-got comfortable with using CLI to add, commit and push.
